# LaTeX Certificate Generator

Takes a CSV list and a base background image, then generates a PDF. For each new row in the CSV, a new page is generated in the PDF.

This is a useful script for generating Certificates with names printed on them or Badges for conferences.

## How to run this script

You'll need LaTeX tools installed to be able to compile. Open up the `.tex` file and run it to be compiled against the `namelist.csv` file.

The script requires an A5 front design and an A5 back design.

## How to update the design

You can update the `A5_badge_back.pdf` file and the `A5_badge_front.pdf` files to change the generated PDF pages.
